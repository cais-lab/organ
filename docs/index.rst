Welcome to OrGAN's documentation!
=================================

OrGAN is a library to leverage the power of generative adversarial networks
(or, GANs) for generating organization structures respecting both formal
constraints (expressed by functions and predicates - differentiable or not)
and expert knowledge (expressed in implicit form via the set of training
examples).
